description: Step by step installation
---

## 0. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oiov/wr.do
```

Enter in the folder and install dependencies for your project:

```bash
cd wrdo
pnpm install
```

### Create a `.env` file

Copy/paste the `.env.example` in the `.env` file

## 1. Configure the Database

### Prepare the Server Database Instance and Obtain the Connection URL

Before deployment, make sure you have prepared a Postgres database instance. You can choose one of the following methods:

- A. Use Serverless Postgres instances like Vercel / Neon;
- B. Use self-deployed Postgres instances like Docker.

The configuration for both methods is slightly different, and will be distinguished in the next step.

### Add Environment Variables in Vercel

In Vercel's deployment environment variables, add `DATABASE_URL` and other environment variables, 
and fill in the Postgres database connection URL prepared in the previous step. 
The typical format for the database connection URL is

`postgres://username:password@host:port/database`.

```js title=".env"
DATABASE_URL=
```

### Deploy Postgres

```bash
pnpm postinstall
pnpm db:push
```

### Add the AUTH_SECRET Environment Variable

The `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable is used to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes(NextAuth.js).
You can generate one from https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32:

```js title=".env"
AUTH_SECRET=a3e686f39b2a878c6866e4604e6f1b1b
```

## 2. Configure Authentication Service

The server-side database needs to be paired with a user authentication service to function properly. 
Therefore, the corresponding authentication service needs to be configured.

We provide the following authentication services:

- Google
- Github
- LinuxDo
- Resend Email Verification

### Google config

In this section, you can update these variables:

```js title=".env"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = your_secret_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com;
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = your_secret_client;
```

See config tutorial in [Authjs - Google OAuth](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/google).

### Github config

In this section, you can update these variables:

```js title=".env"
GITHUB_ID = your_secret_client_id;
GITHUB_SECRET = your_secret_client;
```

See config tutorial in [Authjs - Github OAuth](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/github).

### LinuxDo config

```js title=".env"
LinuxDo_CLIENT_ID=
LinuxDo_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

See config tutorial in [Connect LinuxDo](https://connect.linux.do).

### Resend Email Verification config

<Callout type="note">
  The email part is similar at the [resend](https://resend.com/) documentation.
  You can find the official documentation
  [here](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation#setup-environment) if
  you want.
</Callout>

<Steps>

#### Create an account

If don't have an account on Resend, just follow their steps after signup [here](https://resend.com/signup).

#### Create an API key

After signin on Resend, he propurse you to create your first API key.

Copy/paste in your `.env` file.

```js
RESEND_API_KEY = re_your_resend_api_key;
```

</Steps>

## 3. Cloudflare Configs

Before you start, you must have a Cloudflare account and be hosted on Cloudflare.

### Add the CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID Environment Variable

This is the unique identifier for your Cloudflare zone. You can find it in the Cloudflare dashboard under the Overview section of your domain.

> Follow [this way](https://dash.cloudflare.com/Your_Acount_Id/wr.do), and scroll down to `Zone ID`.

### Add the CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY Environment Variable

 This is the API key that you use to authenticate requests to the Cloudflare API. You can generate or find your API key in the Cloudflare dashboard under the `profile` -> `api-tokens` section.

 > Follow [https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens), and scroll down to `API Token`, the `Global API Key` should be used.

### Add the CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL Environment Variable

This is the email address associated with your Cloudflare account. It is used for authentication alongside the API key.

### Add the CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME Environment Variable

This is the name of your Cloudflare zone. It is used to specify the zone in the Cloudflare API requests.

In this section, you can update these variables:

```js title=".env"
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=abcdef1234567890
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_NAME=wr.do
CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=user@example.com
```

## 4. Email Worker Configs

See detail in [Email Worker](/docs/developer/cloudflare-email-worker).

After you have completed the above steps, you need add a public domain for r2 storage. 

Via:

```bash
 https://dash.cloudflare.com/[account_id]/r2/default/buckets/[bucket]/settings
 ```

![](/_static/docs/r2-domain.png)

```js title=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_R2_DOMAIN=https://email-attachment.wr.do
```

## 5. Add the Bussiness Configs

```js title=".env"
# Allow anyone to sign up
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPEN_SIGNUP=1

# Short domains. Separated by `,`
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHORT_DOMAINS=wr.do,uv.do

# Email domains. Separated by `,`
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_DOMAINS=wr.do,uv.do
```

## 6. Add the SCREENSHOTONE_BASE_URL Environment Variable

It's the base URL for the screenshotone API.

You can deploy your own screenshotone API from [jasonraimondi/url-to-png](https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png). 
Deploy docs via [here](https://jasonraimondi.github.io/url-to-png/)

```js title=".env"
SCREENSHOTONE_BASE_URL=https://api.screenshotone.com
```

## 7. Add the GITHUB_TOKEN Environment Variable

Via https://github.com/settings/tokens to get your token.

```js title=".env"
GITHUB_TOKEN=
```
## 8. Start the Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```
Via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## 9. Problems

### Worker Error - Too many redirects

Via:

```bash
https://dash.cloudflare.com/[account_id]/[zone_name]/ssl-tls/configuration
```

Change the `SSL/TLS Encryption` Mode to `Full` in the Cloudflare dashboard.
