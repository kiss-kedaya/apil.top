Before you start, you must have a Cloudflare account and a domain be hosted on Cloudflare.

### Introduction to Cloudflare Email Worker and R2

#### Cloudflare Email Worker

Cloudflare Email Worker is a feature of Cloudflare's Email Routing service combined with the Workers platform. 
It allows users to process incoming emails programmatically at Cloudflare's edge network. 
When an email is sent to a custom address configured in Email Routing,
the associated Worker is triggered, receiving the email data (e.g., sender, recipient, headers, and body). 
Developers can write JavaScript code to define custom logic, 
such as forwarding emails to specific addresses, filtering spam, 
or integrating with external APIs.

#### Cloudflare R2

Cloudflare R2 (Object Storage) is a scalable, S3-compatible storage solution provided by Cloudflare. 
It allows users to store and retrieve files (e.g., email attachments) at the edge with zero egress fees. 
In the context of an Email Worker, R2 can be used to store email attachments or other data, accessible via environment bindings in the Worker script.

### Overview of cf-email-forwarding-worker

[kiss-kedaya/cf-email-forwarding-worker](https://github.com/kiss-kedaya/cf-email-forwarding-worker), 
implements an advanced email forwarding solution using Cloudflare Email Worker and R2. 
Instead of directly forwarding emails to another email address, 
it sends the email data to a third-party API endpoint for custom processing. 
Additionally, it leverages Cloudflare R2 to store email attachments, making them accessible to the third-party application.

#### Key Features

- **API-based Forwarding**: Emails are sent as structured data to a configurable third-party API (APP_API_URL) via HTTP POST requests.
- **Attachment Storage**: Email attachments are uploaded to an R2 bucket and their URLs are included in the API payload.
- **Customizable**: The third-party app can process the email data (e.g., sender, subject, body, attachments) as needed.
#### Configuration

The Worker relies on two environment variables defined in the wrangler.jsonc file:

```json
"vars": {
  "APP_API_URL": "https://kedaya.xyz/api/v1/email-catcher"
},
"r2_buckets": [
  {
    "binding": "R2_BUCKET",
    "bucket_name": "wremail"
  }
]
```

`APP_API_URL`: The URL of the third-party API endpoint that receives the email data. This allows the third-party app to handle emails in a custom way (e.g., logging, processing, or forwarding).

`R2_BUCKET`: The binding name for the R2 storage bucket, accessible in the Worker code as env.R2_BUCKET. The bucket_name (`wremail`) specifies the R2 bucket where email attachments are stored. Note: R2 must be activated and configured in your Cloudflare account beforehand.

#### How It Works

- Email Reception: An email sent to the configured address triggers the Worker.
- Attachment Handling: If the email contains attachments, they are extracted and uploaded to the R2 bucket (wremail). The Worker generates accessible URLs for these attachments.
- API Forwarding: The email data (e.g., sender, recipient, subject, body, and attachment URLs) is packaged into a JSON payload and sent to the `APP_API_URL` via an HTTP POST request.
- Third-Party Processing: The third-party app receives the payload and processes it according to its own logic.

#### Example Usage

- A user sends an email to example@yourdomain.com.
- The Worker uploads any attachments to the wremail R2 bucket.
- The Worker sends a POST request to https://kedaya.xyz/api/v1/email-catcher with the email details and attachment URLs.
- The third-party app logs the email, stores it in a database, or forwards it elsewhere.
#### Prerequisites
- A Cloudflare account with Email Routing enabled.
- An R2 bucket created and bound to the Worker (e.g., wremail).
- A third-party API endpoint ready to receive POST requests with email data.

### Deploy email worker to Cloudflare

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiss-kedaya/cf-email-forwarding-worker.git
cd cf-email-forwarding-worker
pnpm install

wranler login 
wranler deploy
```
Remember to add your environment variables in `wrangler.jsonc` before deploy.

### Config your domain email rule

Via:
```bash
https://dash.cloudflare.com/[account_id]/[zone_name]/email/routing/routes
```

edit `Catch-all address`, select:
- `Action` -> `Send to a worker` 
- `Destination` -> `wrdo-email-worker`(The worker name you deploy).

Then save and active it.

Once you add a new domain, you need to perform the same action, the email worker can be the same.
